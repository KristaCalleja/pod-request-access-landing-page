## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time I used a Figma design file for my front-end project. My major learning curves were with regard to accessibility, semantic HTML and using JS for form submission with reference to accessibility.

```html
<div class="input-aria-live sr-only" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

```css
*, 
*::before,
*::after{
    box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to study more with regard to JavaScript and forms.
